Changed buildSites output column headers to read UMIs and sonicLengths.
Added additional configuration flags to prepReads that control HMM matching.
Added demultiplex_seqRunID to configuration to track sequencing run ids and added corresponding database table to capture.
  seqRunID is carried in data objects from demultiplex through buildFragments.
Code optimizations for prepReads.
buildStdFragments updated to use UMIs for multiHitCluster abundance metric
  rather than fragment widths. abund column in multiHits replaced with UMIs.

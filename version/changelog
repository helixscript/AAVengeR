Changed buildSites output column headers to read UMIs and sonicLengths.
Added additional configuration flags to prepReads that control HMM matching.
Added demultiplex_seqRunID to configuration to track sequencing run ids and added corresponding database table to capture.
  seqRunID is carried in data objects from demultiplex through buildFragments.
Code optimizations for prepReads.
buildStdFragments updated to use UMIs for multiHitCluster abundance metric
  rather than fragment widths. abund column in multiHits replaced with UMIs.
0.992
Added tsv.gz outputs to modules createStdFragments and above.
0.993
Added list of read ids to multiHits.
Fixed output directory issue with callNearestGene.
0.994
Updated buildStdFrags to handle cases where no unique sites are found, only multihits.
0.995
Added transposon support; config - prepReads_HMMrequireTerminalTA.
Added transposon example config file.
0.996
Added barcodeAssocLinkers.R as a core module and added configuration to example configuration files.
Updated prepReads.R to consider UMIs when idetermining identical reads pairs. 
Added anchorReadRearrangements.R
0.997
Added anchorReadRearrangements.R
0.998
Restructured modules to use tmp/ directories within each module directory rather than a single output/tmp directory.
Added core module.
Added pander library requirement.
0.999
Updated ITR/LTR rearrangement functions using synthetic data.
1.00
Added modes to the confile.
Removed examples/ and provide single example of config and sampleConfig in software root directory.
Added prepReads_HMMmatchTerminalSeq to configFile - replaces CA and TA matching flags.
Added prepReads_useDefaultHMMsettings to configFile - uses data/hmms/*.settings values.
1.01
Fixed issue with buildStdFragments_minReadsPerFrag flag and sites with single fragments.
Added log collation for core module.
Core module now collates multihit results.
1.02
Fixed bug in core CPU scheduler.
1.10
Added requirement for cd-hit-est which is used by buildStdFrags.R to more quickly cluter leader sequences.
Modified multiple code blocks to increase processing speed.
Updated scheduler in the core module.
Added compressDataFiles option to the config file in order to increase processing speed by not compressing rds files.
1.20
Added bwa2 support.
Added new demultiplexing module.
Added support for read clustering.
Added pre-blat read filtering using bwa2.
1.35
Added additional blat options including on the fly OOC file generation.
Corrected break point standardization functions.
Updated UMI handeling.
Split UMI reporting in buildSites into rUMIs and fUMIs.
Added docker build files.
Added config test.
Added small data test.
1.36
Updated code that handeld UMI conflicts.
1.37
Fixed an issue with dual detections and chromosomes with more than one digit.
1.38
Fixed an issue in demultiplex.R involving the calculation of distinct read pairs.

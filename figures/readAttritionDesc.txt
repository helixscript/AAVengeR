(prepReads module)
PRD1 - reads remaining after demultiplexing module completed.
PRD2 - reads remaining after trimming common linker over-read and removing short sequences.
PRD3 - reads remaining after vector similarity filter.
PRD4 - reads remaining after removing those without recognizable LTR sequences.
PRD5 - reads remaining after removing those with short gDNA segments
 
(alignReads module)
ALR1 - anchor reads with alignments to the reference genome.
ALR2 - anchor reads remaining after removing those with only partial alignments.
ALR3 - adrift reads with alignments to the reference genome.
ALR4 - adrift reads remaining after removing those with only partial alignments.
ALR5 - reads remaining after both anchor and adrift reads have â‰¥ 1 good alignments.

12.06.2024  7:55pm	Reading in prepped reads.
12.06.2024  7:55pm	Aligning 1,800 anchor reads to reference genomes.
12.06.2024  7:59pm	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
12.06.2024  7:59pm	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.

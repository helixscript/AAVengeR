11.26.2024  4:23pm	Reading in prepped reads.
11.26.2024  4:23pm	Aligning 614 anchor reads to reference genomes.
11.26.2024  4:27pm	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
11.26.2024  4:27pm	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.

11.26.2024  4:31pm	100.00% of prepped adrift reads aligned to the reference genome.
11.26.2024  4:31pm	0.00% of adrift reads removed because their alignments ended more than 10 NTs from the end of reads.

12.06.2024  7:28pm	Reading in prepped reads.
12.06.2024  7:28pm	Aligning 1,740 anchor reads to reference genomes.
12.06.2024  7:32pm	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
12.06.2024  7:32pm	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.

11.22.2024  4:24am	Reading in prepped reads.
11.22.2024  4:24am	Aligning 756 anchor reads to reference genomes.
11.22.2024  4:33am	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
11.22.2024  4:33am	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
11.22.2024  4:33am	Aligning 756 adrift reads to reference genomes.
11.22.2024  4:40am	100.00% of prepped adrift reads aligned to the reference genome.
11.22.2024  4:40am	0.00% of adrift reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
11.22.2024  4:40am	Finding read pairs where both anchor and adrift read pair mates aligned well.

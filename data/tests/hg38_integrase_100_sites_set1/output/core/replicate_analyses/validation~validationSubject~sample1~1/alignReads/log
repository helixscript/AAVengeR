11.06.2024  6:21am	Reading in prepped reads.
11.06.2024  6:21am	Aligning 498 anchor reads to reference genomes.
11.06.2024  6:29am	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
11.06.2024  6:29am	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
11.06.2024  6:29am	Aligning 498 adrift reads to reference genomes.
11.06.2024  6:37am	100.00% of prepped adrift reads aligned to the reference genome.
11.06.2024  6:37am	0.00% of adrift reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
11.06.2024  6:37am	Finding read pairs where both anchor and adrift read pair mates aligned well.

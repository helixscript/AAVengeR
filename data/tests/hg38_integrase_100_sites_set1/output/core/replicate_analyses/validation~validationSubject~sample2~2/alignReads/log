12.06.2024  7:28pm	Reading in prepped reads.
12.06.2024  7:28pm	Aligning 3,240 anchor reads to reference genomes.
12.06.2024  7:34pm	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
12.06.2024  7:34pm	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.

12.06.2024  7:39pm	100.00% of prepped adrift reads aligned to the reference genome.
12.06.2024  7:39pm	0.00% of adrift reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.

12.18.2024  3:53pm	Reading in prepped reads.
12.18.2024  3:53pm	Aligning 498 anchor reads to reference genomes.
12.18.2024  4:02pm	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
12.18.2024  4:02pm	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
12.18.2024  4:02pm	Aligning 498 adrift reads to reference genomes.
12.18.2024  4:10pm	100.00% of prepped adrift reads aligned to the reference genome.
12.18.2024  4:10pm	0.00% of adrift reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.

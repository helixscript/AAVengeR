04.03.2025  9:40pm	Reading in prepped reads.
04.03.2025  9:40pm	Aligning 379 anchor reads to reference genomes.
04.03.2025  9:44pm	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
04.03.2025  9:44pm	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
04.03.2025  9:44pm	Aligning 379 adrift reads to reference genomes.
04.03.2025  9:46pm	100.00% of prepped adrift reads aligned to the reference genome.
04.03.2025  9:46pm	0.00% of adrift reads removed because their alignments ended more than 10 NTs from the end of reads.
04.03.2025  9:46pm	Finding read pairs where both anchor and adrift read pair mates aligned well.
04.03.2025  9:46pm	alignReads completed.

04.03.2025  6:34pm	Reading in prepped reads.
04.03.2025  6:34pm	Aligning 364 anchor reads to reference genomes.
04.03.2025  6:36pm	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
04.03.2025  6:36pm	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
04.03.2025  6:36pm	Aligning 364 adrift reads to reference genomes.
04.03.2025  6:37pm	100.00% of prepped adrift reads aligned to the reference genome.
04.03.2025  6:37pm	0.00% of adrift reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
04.03.2025  6:37pm	Finding read pairs where both anchor and adrift read pair mates aligned well.
04.03.2025  6:37pm	alignReads completed.

02.05.2024  5:18pm	Reading in prepped reads.
02.05.2024  5:18pm	Aligning 471 anchor reads to reference genomes.
02.05.2024  5:25pm	100.00% of prepped anchor reads aligned to the reference genome.
02.05.2024  5:25pm	0.00% of anchor reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
02.05.2024  5:25pm	Aligning 471 adrift reads to reference genomes.
02.05.2024  5:32pm	100.00% of prepped adrift reads aligned to the reference genome.
02.05.2024  5:32pm	0.00% of adrift reads removed because their alignments ended more than 5 NTs from the end of reads.
02.05.2024  5:32pm	Finding read pairs where both anchor and adrift read pair mates aligned well.
